##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze bike shares from London and gain insights into bike usage patterns, popular ride season, peak ride times, and more. By visualizing the data using Tableau, I aimed to make the findings more accessible and understandable for a wider audience.

Data Sources

The data used for this analysis is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset). It includes information about bike rides in London, including ride duration, start and end locations, ride dates, and more.

Tableau Visualization

The main visualization is created using Tableau, which allows for interactive exploration of the bike ride data. The visualization provides insights into:

Total rides over time
Peak ride hours
Popular ride start and end locations
Average ride duration
[Additional insights]
To access the Tableau visualization, follow these steps:
